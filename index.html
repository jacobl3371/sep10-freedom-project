    <div class="p-8 border-b-0 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 sm:grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-2 2xl:grid-rows-1">

        <div class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 md:col-span-2 md:row-span-2 md:col-start-1 md:row-start-1 p-4 2xl:row-span-1 2xl:col-span-1 2xl:row-start-1 2xl:col-start-1 bg-gray-100 rounded-xl space p-4">
            <div class="space"><h1 class="text-lg text-black">Context</h1></div>
            <p class="p-2">When accessing all of the day to day services and viewing information on the web I believe that it is essential –and have found for myself that it eliminates such intrusions as spam and other data mining– to use Tor browser, which utilizes the Tor anonymity network which allows the user to access websites without them seeing the user's real IP address and subsequently, location by routing all traffic over the Tor network, and uses isolation features built into the browser to isolate all browser activity from the rest of the activity on the operating system. Many educational services which students must use throughout their lives such as the DOE-gatewayed, nycstudents.net Google Classroom login, and even the non-DOE Google Classroom block the only software, which by default is a sure-shot to anonymity and protection: Tor, and its decentralized relay enabled IP addresses which the user assumes once they attempt to enter a website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 md:col-span-1 md:row-span-1 md:col-start-3 md:row-start-1 p-4 2xl:row-span-1 2xl:col-span-1 2xl:row-start-1 2xl:col-start-2 bg-gray-100 rounded-xl space p-4">
            <div class="space"><h1 class="text-lg text-black">Addressing The Issue</h1></div>
            <p class="p-2">My topic is about how to facilitate the most compartmentalized, and pseudonymous access to your education, this being something that the infrastructure of public education in the ever growing digital age is lacking. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that many educational services block access to their websites through Tor browser.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 md:col-span-1 md:row-span-1 md:col-start-3 md:row-start-2 p-4 2xl:row-span-1 2xl:col-span-1 2xl:row-start-1 2xl:col-start-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-xl space p-4">
            <div class="space"><h1 class="text-lg text-black">Identifying My Goal</h1></div>
            <p class="p-2">Perhaps, if sites block access through the Tor network, accessing them through Tor browser would require the use of a different network. This way, my goal is to make educational services that block the Tor network accessible through Tor browser by configuring an installation of the browser to route all of its traffic through a VPN service instead of the Tor network.

The only VPN which can be attained and configured over Tor in Tor browser to have the site see the VPN’s IP address and not the Tor network is Anonymous VPN (vpn.sn) which is only designed, <a href="https://vpn.sn/" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800">this being advertised on the vpn.sn website,</a> for two operating systems in the entire world; the hardware based, external-drive-running live system, Tails, and the virtualized system which is designed to be used in a virtual machine, Whonix (pronounced 'hoo-nix'), the only secure way to use this OS being the default setup on the compartmentalizational internal-drive system Qubes. It is exponentially easier to use Tails than Qubes and Whonix in general, especially for configuring files on the operating system when setting up the VPN network to be used instead of the Tor network.

                  For the most part, the topic of anonymity and privacy on the internet are clickbait, any windows-based pc with a graphics card and cpu which are both Intel and do not have any proprietary-software tied to their hardware can fully operate any linux distro, including Tails which is the only easily usable, vastly accessible OS (unlike Whonix which is only as secure as Tails on the super convoluted, difficult to use Qubes OS) which first of all supports, and has the VPN made for it, which is the only VPN you can acquire which has any documentation for a configuration after the Tor-network and before the site which actually sees the IP and decides if it is allowed to enter, and second of all uses Tor for all of the operation on the OS, exponentially limiting any place where data could be leaked and collected by other applications, especially on windows (or even mac and chrome os) that collect all data and lock down the system, stream lining personally-identifying data collection when you use identity-linked school/work services on browsers and operating systems which collect and distribute everything.

                  Any hardware made by Apple or Microsoft, or a Google-implemented chromebook for that matter, will most likely not work for the super specific setup of accessing services which block Tor while still entering the website through Tor browser, at least without hardware modification, regardless of the cpu and graphics card being Intel as they have proprietary software tied to key hardware features. Most likely every old intel macbook, definitely the last Intel laptop Apple made in 2017, has proprietary code in the wifi adapter that prevents its use on any linux system, and requires an external adapter which you must buy (at a hefty price of $80), and that is not the one which belongs to Apple even though you paid for the entire device, including the internal wifi adapter.

                <p>In short, in order to be able to functionally operate the linux system which is required for transcending sites blockage of the Tor network while still retaining your compartmentalized psuedonymity, you would need a laptop which is not manufactured by Apple, Microsoft or Google, and doesn't have any of their hardware tied to proprietary software only in their operating systems their operating systems.

                As long as you have a PC which is not a chromebook or macbook and comes with Windows preinstalled, uses Intel for both the graphics card and cpu, and is a regular non-gaming model laptop produced by either Lenovo, HP, or even Dell, Asus or Acer than it will have no problem being compatible with all linux distributions including Tails which is required to facilitate this project. You will want a newer PC with Windows 11 pre-installed and more than 2GB (at least 8) of RAM to be able to run Tails. You will also need two usb sticks, one thumb drive for running Tails and one regular usb stick for installing Debian beforehand on your PC which most likely runs windows 11 and can not be used without creating a Microsoft account and linking your phone number to all operation on the device, requiring a seperate old computer running windows 10, which can most likely be used for free at any public library, to install Debian on and than replace the operating system of the hard drive of your new windows 11 laptop with that of the free open source GNU linux operating system, from which you will be free to use your laptop to install Tails and burn it to the thumb drive with pre-installed Debian software that is completly unavailable and has no alternative on Windows.

The only VPN which can be attained and configured over Tor in Tor browser to have the site see VPN’s IP address is Anonymous VPN (vpn.sn) which requires which is only configured, this being advertised on the vpn.sn website as well, for two operating systems in the entire world, the hardware based, external drive running live system, Tails, and the virtualized system which is designed to be used in a virtual machine, the only secure way being the default setup on the compartmentalizational internal-drive system Qubes. It is exponentially easier to use Tails in general, especially for configuring files on the operating system when setting up the VPN network to be used instead of the Tor network.

              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 lg:col-span-1 lg:row-span-1 lg:col-start-2 p-2">To acquire the vpn.sn service, the user needs to pay with Bitcoin, the universal crypto currency, which unlike the other crypto currencies the service accepts, can not only be acquired anonymously, but also used anonymously in Tails which uses Tor to route all operation by default including the pre-installed Electrum Bitcoin wallet application and doesn't even require persistent storage to be enabled as the wallet can be restored via the generated seed when it i's first created, which you would write down somewhere else anyways to have some redundancies to secure your money! Though of course keeping as little data saved in the persistent storage is optimal for keeping everything you don’t want saved to be anonymized and unlinked from all other data on the OS.

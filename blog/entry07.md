Presenting My Freedom Project

I presented my freedom project at the sep10 expo, and also got the chance to present my project in class. I spent way too long on my product and didn't focus on the MVP. When trying to facilitate a complex setup using code which relies on certain softwares working in conjunction with each other, you should not wait until the last minute to set up everything, as it may not work which led to a lot of time being wasted, and not being able to make a presentable product. All of the research on the topic should be complete by around April, before you begin to work on the website, game, or wathever the product is.

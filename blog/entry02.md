# Entry 2
### Software and Hardware I Have Found Pretaining to My Topic
* 1st search: “online education websites used in schools”
* 1st website looked into: https://www.albert.io/blog/educational-teacher-websites/
    * After I looked at that website it contained a list of many other websites including the [The New York Times Learning Network](https://www.nytimes.com/section/learning/lesson-plans) which is the first website I looked at
    * https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/19/learning/LNBandsLN/LNBandsLN-facebookJumbo.png 
    * This stood out to me because the NY Times published a lot of tech/privacy articles in the past before, especially recently during the pandemic with          the fast adaptation of online learning tools having to completely replace the standard classroom at times
    * The website supports tor network, and even has a .onion website that you will automatically be redirected to if you have the setting enabled to always     * prioritize the version of sites ending in  .onion over their normal url (.onion website [only works in tor browser/network])   https://www.nytimesn7cgmftshazwhfgzm37qxb44r64ytbb2dj3x62d2lljsciiyd.onion/section/learning/lesson-plans 

### How I expanded on the knowledge of my topic since Entry 1. 
Since blog entry 1, I have further researched my topic and how to achieve my specific goal which is meant to address and solve the problem which I defined which is limited access to online educational services needed to facilitate education through anonymous (more so psuedononymous) and compartmentalized means.

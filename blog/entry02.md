# Entry 2
### Software and Hardware I Have Found Pretaining to My Topic
* 1st search: “online education websites used in schools”
* 1st website looked into: https://www.albert.io/blog/educational-teacher-websites/
    * After I looked at that website it contained a list of many other websites including the [The New York Times Learning Network](https://www.nytimes.com/section/learning/lesson-plans) which is the first website I looked at
    * https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/19/learning/LNBandsLN/LNBandsLN-facebookJumbo.png 
    * This stood out to me because the NY Times published a lot of tech/privacy articles in the past before, especially recently during the pandemic with          the fast adaptation of online learning tools having to completely replace the standard classroom at times
    * The website supports tor network, and even has a .onion website that you will automatically be redirected to if you have the setting enabled to always     * prioritize the version of sites ending in  .onion over their normal url [.onion website (only works in tor browser/network)]( https://www.nytimesn7cgmftshazwhfgzm37qxb44r64ytbb2dj3x62d2lljsciiyd.onion/section/learning/lesson-plans)

### How I Expanded On the Knowledge of My Topic Since Entry 1. 
Since blog entry 1, I have further researched my topic and how to achieve my specific goal which is meant to address and solve the problem which I defined which is limited access to online educational services needed to facilitate education through an anonymous,more so psuedononymous and compartmentalized means. I further researched which vpns can actually be used over tor browser to add an extra hop after/replace the publicly posted and known tor exit relays and mask from a website the fact that you are accessing it through tor browser by having the website see the vpn ip address instead. In all of the guides to do this, they only mentioned how to add the second, custom installation of tor that will have its traffic be routed through a vpn before entering and being seen by the website server on the linux system Tails. I could not find any reliable guides for any vpns except for [anonymous vpn](https://vpn.sn/) but due to its dedication to the privacy of the user, as well as its own privacy, anonymous vpn only accepts payment in the form of crypto. I tried researching other vpns such as express vpn, which accepts credit/debit, but [the guide for configuring express vpn over tor in tails](https://www.privacyaffairs.com/vpn-with-tails/) being to cryptic, lacking of necessary details, and hard to follow, as well as lacking any clear details on how to download the required vot.sh script which for anonymous vpn, is as simple as as typing vpn.sn/vot.sh into the browser. 

### Engineering Design Process
Following my research I expanded on my design, to ultimately facilitate my prototype. I download

### Skills
A skill I expanded upon was problem decomposition.

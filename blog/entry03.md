### Topic: Attaining Free and Compartmentalized Access Your Education Online

#### Context
  In my previous blogs, I have been referring [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0GMU7sVECI) as the only sufficient guide for configuring a VPN over Tor in Tails. What the tutorial did not go over, however, was the payment method for users who want to use crypto and be fully anonymous, a choice which the company ultimately made themselves after they already published those videos; no longer accepting non-crypto payment methods as of writing blog 3. A new, revamped and polished tutorial needs to be available, as the guides by Anonymous VPN are not sufficient for most users who do not use crypto, or really now anything about it. The guide must explain what I had to research on my own; how to attain crypto currency and how to use it.

#### Engineering Design Process
  During my research of this project, I needed to attain a more reliable workstation as my Surface tablet with its usb keyboard was not reliable for day-to-day, non touch-screen enabled operation on Tails and other linux distros. As soon as the keyboard let down and I had to reinstall Windows just to use the tablet, my budget allowed me to either purchase a new one or a cheap laptop. I found that an Amazon refurbished 2017 Macbook Air was my best and only option for this project. 

  What I found shortly after booting Tails, though, was the computer's internal wifi adapter's incompatibility with the linux operating system. It has something to do with proprietary software installed on the driver, meaning software that subsequently hinders customizability of the entire computer and the use of open source systems such as Tails, as with that software, the hardware it is installed on is the "intellectual property" of Broadcom and/or Apple and technically doesn't belong to the user even though they bought the entire device. The use of *their* hardware only extends as far as the intended operation which 95% of users of the Apple device are performing anyways, plugging in an external adapter to the present second usb-A port in the old Macbook being the only solution. 
  
  I found that this is an issue on almost all linux systems, defenitely all of the ones I tried on the Macbook, and that I would have the best chance of getting wifi if I plugged in an [external wifi adapter which I know supports Tails,](https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/no-wifi/index.en.html) ultimately finding documentation from the official Tails website wherein the Panda wireles PAU05 device was listed

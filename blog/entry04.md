# Entry 4

### Context
For this unit of the Freedom Project, I had to find a software tool which I will incorporate into my Freedom Project website. Instead of continuing to learn about my chosen topic for the project which I was writing about in the first three blogs, I instead had to use that time to learn a new software tool, tinkering and looking at documentation and video tutorials to get a feel for the tool and eventually be able to solidify one to build the Freedom Project website.

### Choosing my Tool
To find the right tool, I had to consider what I wanted it to do. I needed a tool to build webpages with different icons and custom CSS which are used to illustrate the software which I am discusing in my freedom project. I want to design my website to illustrate for example, the way sites such as the Google classroom login can be accessed even through Tor browser by having the IP address which the server sees being the VPN's. The type of tool I need is further narrowed down when considering the way I aim to showcase the future inventions I am thinking about for this project. I want to integrate the software which search engines such as Startpage use on their site to have the user access a proxy within the browser by clicking a button, though my website will just have the CSS icon and is not going to lead to any proxy. I will try to make the button lead to another webpage to symbolize how the software works but this may require more extensive knowledge of Javascript so I might end up just doing a diagram with purely icons and CSS elements.

I looked at many other software tools on the list, but I couldn't figure out how to set up any of them except for TailwindCSS which I struggled with at first despite numerous attempts and video tutorials, since the npm setup didn't work for my Virtual Studio Code enabled IDE, most likely due to an error on my part which I can't figure out, and other videos only mentioned setups for completely different IDEs like React. I finally stumbled upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYowvsUiChs) which showed me how to setup a webpage with a responsive navbar using only the Tailwind CSS play CDN script in one HTML file. 

Everything else initially worked but I was unable to configure the menu to be clickable and display the hidden text. So instead followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CsbhSVUEc) and I was finally able to build a responsive navigation bar which collapes all of its displayed text when the screen-width is as narrow as a phone, turning into a menu which is clickable via Javascript, upon which it displays that collapsed text and an x icon to close out the menu. I also used [this code checker](https://zzzcode.ai/) to debug my broken code.

### Skills
1. I improved my **logical reasoning** skills as though I did not know and had never used Javascript before, I was able to follow the directions and make the navigation menu work with Javascript. I also saw that the first setup did not work in making the menu clickable and interactive, and I decided to try the other video which after following its instructions produced a working menu and navigation bar.
   
2. I learned to **embrace failure** and keep on trying to set up my tool even though it was very overwhelming at the start and the first tutorial which I managed to get to work didn't produce the expected outcome. I kept on trying despite failure and using what I learned to ultimately use the tool to achieve my desired outcome, getting the navigation bar to work.

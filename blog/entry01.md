# Entry 1: Consumer services shaping education
## Choosing a topic
The topic I chose was consumer services and their role in education, having a strong focus on the social implications the use of these service has when they are responsible for handling student's data and student's entire identities which thies into political organization as this is the industry that directly impacts how society and aspcts such as edcation are structured; being completely responsible in the case of breaches of this data. This way, political organization would be my backup idea and was my initial idea in terms of importance, but there is not much really to write about it as an industry in terms of how it impacts which consumer services are used to facilitate education, so I just stuck with the merger of the other two. Some interesting links about this topic include: [Shift to online learning ignites student privacy concerns](https://www.iapp.org/news/a/shift-to-online-learning-ignites-student-privacy-concerns/)

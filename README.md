# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Jacob Levit**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of accessing online services which block [The Onion Router (Tor);](https://torproject.org/) an anonymity newtork utilized through Tor browser and entire operating systems such as [Tails](https://tails.net) which have the browser preinstalled, while still retaining the pseudonymity and compartmentalization from the rest of the data throughout your operating system and devices that accessing identity-tied services like Google Classroom via the Tor browser and network brings.

My website focused specifically on a service which most public schools students already must use to access their education every day, Google Classroom, and the current city-wide implemented nycstudents.net login which redirects students to the official NYC DOE login, (idpcloud.nycenet.edu) that can not be accessed anonymously in Tor browser since the DOE server blocks the Tor network with a hard-set firewall. The Google classroom url in of itself and any normal Google service (like docs, slides), once a workspace login is detected, usually blocks access through Tor, but since it is not as strict as the DOE login can be easily and reliably bypassed and accessed in Tor browser via existing free in-browser technologies like startpage, while the nycstudents.net login blocks even that.

I tried to see how much agency a K-12 student could attain over the data collected on them daily by Google, the Department of Education, and any third-party serices engrained into Google Classroom and school-issued devices which work in conjunction with Google and the DOE.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study the [CSS framework Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) in order to help me make by website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* The reliance upon internet-enabled technologies to facilitate education and eventually more and more aspects of life is imperative, whether sooner or later
* The technologies which companies like Google and Microsoft create simply could not be made or even replicated to an on-par scale by any other developers and engineers, and this is not just because they keep most of this code closed, but because some of the best developers and engineers from around the world work for these now-unavoidable Big Tech facilitators
    * Essentially Google took the initiative upon nobody elses behest than perhap's the government's, to develop the groundbreaking Classroom for Education learning network most educators in public schools in the United States and many other countries rely upon

##### CONS
* The DOE and Google could easily make their services accessible through Tor, but instead choose to rely upon the ignorance of the populus, and the hope that future generations will accept handing over ever-increasing ammounts of data to access the resources and services which are required to live in society
* As more and more aspects of life rely on internet-enabled technologies, Big Tech companies and governments have a greater opportunity to trap society into having no way to avoid being spied on throughout all aspects of their life as more and more services become web based and can take the liberty, as Google Classroom does, to block the only free and open-sourced anonymization network Tor, ensuring that they can only be accessed through a browser which allows those services to infiltrate the user's entire operating system, and all of the devices that you access the internet through with that same IP address, Google effectively linking all data on that device and the computer you use to sign into Google Classroom on a regular browser with even just that data.

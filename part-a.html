Though of course keeping as little data saved in the persistent storage is optimal for keeping everything you don’t want saved to be anonymized and unlinked from all other data on the OS.

                For the most part, the topic of anonymity and privacy on the internet are clickbait, any windows-based pc with a graphics card and cpu which are both Intel and do not have any proprietary-software tied to their hardware can fully operate any linux distro, including Tails which is the only easily usable, vastly accessible OS (unlike Whonix which is only as secure as Tails on the super convoluted, difficult to use Qubes OS) which first of all supports, and has the VPN made for it, which is the only VPN you can acquire which has any documentation for a configuration after the Tor-network and before the site which actually sees the IP and decides if it is allowed to enter, and second of all uses Tor for all of the operation on the OS, exponentially limiting any place where data could be leaked and collected by other applications, especially on windows (or even mac and chrome os) that collect all data and lock down the system, stream lining personally-identifying data collection when you use identity-linked school/work services on browsers and Operating systems which collect and distribute everything.

            <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 lg:col-span-1 lg:row-span-1 lg:col-start-2 p-2">
                Any hardware made by Apple or Microsoft, or a Google-implemented chromebook for that matter, will most likely not work for the super specific setup of accessing services which block Tor while still entering the website through Tor browser, at least without hardware modification, regardless of the cpu and graphics card being Intel as they have proprietary software tied to key hardware features. Most likely every old intel macbook, definitely the last Intel laptop Apple made in 2017, has proprietary code in the wifi adapter that prevents its use on any linux system, and requires an external adapter which you must buy (at a hefty price of $80), and that is not the one which belongs to Apple even though you paid for the entire device, including the internal wifi adapter.

The only VPN which can be attained and configured over Tor in Tor browser to have the site see the VPN’s IP address and not the Tor network is Anonymous VPN (vpn.sn) which is only designed, <a href="https://vpn.sn/" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800">this being advertised on the vpn.sn website,</a> for two operating systems in the entire world; the hardware based, external-drive-running live system, Tails, and the virtualized system which is designed to be used in a virtual machine, Whonix (pronounced 'hoo-nix'), the only secure way to use this OS being the default setup on the compartmentalizational internal-drive system Qubes. It is exponentially easier to use Tails than Qubes and Whonix in general, especially for configuring files on the operating system when setting up the VPN network to be used instead of the Tor network.

Though of course keeping as little data saved in the persistent storage is optimal for keeping everything you don’t want saved to be anonymized and unlinked from all other data on the OS.

                For the most part, the topic of anonymity and privacy on the internet are clickbait, any windows-based pc with a graphics card and cpu which are both Intel and do not have any proprietary-software tied to their hardware can fully operate any linux distro, including Tails which is the only easily usable, vastly accessible OS (unlike Whonix which is only as secure as Tails on the super convoluted, difficult to use Qubes OS) which first of all supports, and has the VPN made for it, which is the only VPN you can acquire which has any documentation for a configuration after the Tor-network and before the site which actually sees the IP and decides if it is allowed to enter, and second of all uses Tor for all of the operation on the OS, exponentially limiting any place where data could be leaked and collected by other applications, especially on windows (or even mac and chrome os) that collect all data and lock down the system, stream lining personally-identifying data collection when you use identity-linked school/work services on browsers and operating systems which collect and distribute everything.

                Any hardware made by Apple or Microsoft, or a Google-implemented chromebook for that matter, will most likely not work for the super specific setup of accessing services which block Tor while still entering the website through Tor browser, at least without hardware modification, regardless of the cpu and graphics card being Intel as they have proprietary software tied to key hardware features. Most likely every old intel macbook, definitely the last Intel laptop Apple made in 2017, has proprietary code in the wifi adapter that prevents its use on any linux system, and requires an external adapter which you must buy (at a hefty price of $80), and that is not the one which belongs to Apple even though you paid for the entire device, including the internal wifi adapter.

              <p>In short, in order to be able to functionally operate the linux system which is required for transcending sites blockage of the Tor network while still retaining your compartmentalized psuedonymity, you would need a laptop which is not manufactured by Apple, Microsoft or Google, and doesn't have any of their hardware tied to proprietary software only in their operating systems their operating systems.

You will want a newer PC with Windows 11 pre-installed and more than 2GB (at least 8) of RAM to be able to run Tails. You will also need two usb sticks, one thumb drive for running Tails and one regular usb stick for installing Debian beforehand on your PC which most likely runs windows 11 and can not be used without creating a Microsoft account and linking your phone number to all operation on the device, requiring a seperate old computer running windows 10, which can most likely be used for free at any public library, to install Debian on and than replace the operating system of the hard drive of your new windows 11 laptop with that of the free open source GNU linux operating system, from which you will be free to use your laptop to install Tails and burn it to the thumb drive with pre-installed Debian software that is completly unavailable and has no alternative on Windows.
